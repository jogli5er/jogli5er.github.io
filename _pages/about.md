I'm interested in a wide field of studies, but my current research focuses on computer architecture. Specifically, I'm working on specialized microarchitectures in processor frontends for cloud computing workloads to improve energy efficiency and lowering environmental impact. Currently, I'm working on improving caching efficiency to reduce the pressure on the core's frontend.

Outside my primary field of study, I'm highly interested in local and international politics and negotiations. I highly encourage engineering and natural science students to get negotiation training, as the knowledge we gain during our education and on the job is highly important to modern society.
