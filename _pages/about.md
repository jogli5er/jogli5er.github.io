I am passionate about enhancing processor frontend efficiency to optimize cloud computing performance. My diverse academic interests bridge computer engineering, science, and multilateral negotiations, fostering a unique interdisciplinary approach to technological challenges.

## Research

As a PhD candidate at the [Norwegian University for Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/), my research centers on microarchitectural and algorithmic specializations in processor frontends for cloud computing. These projects aim to enhance efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of cloud services—an increasingly crucial challenge as global internet adoption accelerates.

Achieving a truly efficient cloud computing stack requires optimizations across multiple layers, including hardware, operating systems, compiler support, and workload management. I’m particularly passionate about co-optimizing these elements to drive meaningful advancements in cloud infrastructure.

## Negotiation

Beyond my technical work, I have a strong interest in politics and international negotiations. From 2020 to 2024, I served on the board of the [Institute for Global Negotiations (IGN)](https://www.global-negotiation.org/), advocating for the importance of negotiation skills—especially among engineers.

I firmly believe that every engineer should have foundational negotiation training. Not only is it valuable for personal situations like salary discussions, but it also enhances professional effectiveness. Engineers frequently collaborate with diverse stakeholders, and strong negotiation skills help bridge technical and strategic decision-making. If you're looking to develop these skills, I highly recommend exploring negotiation training opportunities at your host organization or participating in the [Global Negotiation Conference](https://www.global-negotiation.org/gnc), a summer school hosted by IGN. If those aren't an option, feel free to reach out to me or the team at IGN for other opportunities.
